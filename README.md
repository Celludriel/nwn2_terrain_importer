=====================

NWN2 L3DT terrain importer

This is a plugin for the NWN2 toolset.  It generates Areas based on either a grayscale bitmap or a L3DT project.

It makes use of a self written library to read and write L3DT files L3dtFileManager.dll.  Misc.dll is also included for the use of the EndianBinaryWriter and EndianBinaryReader in L3dtFileManager.

It is based on an old version of a similar tool, but redesigned from the ground up with a new more modern GUI.

This version is tested with :
